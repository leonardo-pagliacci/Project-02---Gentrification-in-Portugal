### Key Findings:
## 1. Economic Landscape and Gentrification Measures:

### Economic Overview of Portugal (2008-2022):

Portugal's economic journey from 2008 to 2022 reveals intriguing trends. Real minimum wages in 2022 stand at approximately half of Germany's, shedding light on income disparities. Annual net earnings and real GDP per capita show a positive trajectory from 2015 to 2022 across Portugal, Europe, and Germany. These indicators reflect an evolving economic landscape, with notable percentage increases.

### Gentrification Indicators (2008-2022):

Gentrification is often intricately linked to economic shifts and consumer behavior. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and Housing Cost Index offer valuable insights. From 2008 to 2022, these indices indicate a consistent upward trend in consumer prices and housing costs in Portugal compared to the European average and Germany. The surge is particularly pronounced, suggesting the presence of gentrification dynamics.

## 2. International Mobility (2015-2022):

### Migration and Demographic Shifts:

The years from 2015 to 2019 witnessed a substantial surge in the foreign resident population in Portugal, further intensified by the data from 2022, revealing a total of 174,000 residents from the EU and 607,000 from non-EU countries. This profound increase underscores a significant demographic shift, with a notable 1/3 of the foreign population originating from EU nations. The changing landscape not only reflects global mobility trends but also suggests potential implications for Portugal's cultural fabric and societal dynamics.

### Economic Challenges and Real Estate Dynamics:

While international mobility has contributed to Portugal's evolving demographics, it also sheds light on the country's economic challenges. The influx of foreign residents, particularly from non-EU countries, could be attributed, in part, to Portugal's relatively weaker economic position compared to its EU counterparts. The allure of Portugal, however, lies not only in its economic landscape but also in the remarkable surge in real estate prices, especially evident in Lisbon.

### Soaring Real Estate in Lisbon:

Lisbon, the epicenter of economic and cultural activities, witnessed a staggering 115% increase in real estate prices from 2015 to 2022. This meteoric rise is a testament to the city's growing global prominence but also points to potential challenges, including gentrification pressures. The juxtaposition of economic weaknesses and skyrocketing real estate prices in Lisbon underscores the intricate interplay between economic shifts, international mobility, and the evolving identity of this vibrant city.
